# Post-office Management Information System (MIS)

## Project Overview

This project aims to design and develop a comprehensive Post-office Management Information System (MIS) to streamline the operations of a post office. The system will include a web application for efficient and reliable post office services and a mobile application for postmen to record addresses on a map during mail delivery. The system will replace the traditional manual processes, making postal services more efficient and user-friendly.
